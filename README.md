# Oquonie

Oquonie is a textless puzzle game for iPad and iPhone created in collaboration with illustrator Rekka Bellum where you must find your way across an intertwined megastructure. You will not be alone, your incarnations will have the help of bizaroid characters speaking an obscure language.

Feel free to send pull requests if you find an issue that you wish to correct.
